/**
 * Sink of graph events.
 *
 * <p>
 * An output is something that can receive graph events. The output will send or
 * transform the graph events in another form: a file, a network stream, a
 * visualization, an algorithm, a metric, etc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The output can filter the stream of attribute events using
 * {@link AttributePredicate}s.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * This listener is in fact the grouping of two specialized listeners. The first
 * one listens only at structural changes in the graph (node and edge addition
 * and removal). It is the {@link org.graphstream.stream.ElementSink}. The
 * second one listens only at attributes values changes on elements of the graph
 * (attribute addition, removal and change of values). It is the
 * {@link org.graphstream.stream.AttributeSink}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is possible to listen only at elements or attributes changes with these
 * two interfaces. Registering a graph listener will allow to listen at the both
 * elements and attributes at the same time.
 * </p>
