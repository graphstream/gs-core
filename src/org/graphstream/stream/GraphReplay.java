/**
 * A simple source of graph events that takes an existing graph and creates a
 * flow of events by enumerating all nodes, edges and attributes of the graph.
 *
 * <p>
 * The only method of this class is {@link #replay(Graph)} that takes a graph as
 * argument and :
 * <ul>
 * <li>First exports all graph attributes as attribute-addition events.</li>
 * <li>Then exports all nodes as node-creation events.
 * <ul>
 * <li>For each node exports all the node attributes as attribute-addition
 * events.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Then exports all edges ad edge-creation events.
 * <ul>
 * <li>For each edge exports all the edge attribute as attribute-addition
 * events.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * In this order.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this is a source, not a pipe. This means that it has its own
 * identifier and is a producer of "new" events. Also note that is does not
 * export the dynamics of the graph, only its structure at the present time (the
 * evolution of the graph is not stored in the graph, to produce a dynamic flow
 * of events of the evolution of a graph you have to register the sinks in the
 * graph itself just after its creation).
 * </p>
