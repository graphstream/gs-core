/**
 * <h1 class="title">NetStream</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * The NetStream framework allows to export the idea of &quot;streams of graph
 * events&quot; to other languages than Java, through a network interface. The
 * aim is mainly to allow the use of GraphStream with other projects written in
 * other languages. However, since it is a network interface it also allows the
 * use of several machines. The protocol is optimized to be have as low overhead
 * as possible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are looking for a Java-to-Java network link between GraphStream and
 * some other project, you may prefer GraphStream's <a
 * class="reference external" href=
 * "http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/Using-remote-source_1.0/"
 * >RMI</a> facilities.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This document is organized in 3 sections. The first one details the
 * Receiver's mechanisms. The second section describes the Sender. The last
 * section details the NetStream Protocol.
 * </p>
 * <div class="section" id="receiver"> <h1>Receiver</h1>
 * <p>
 * This one is responsible for receiving graph events from the network following
 * the &quot;NetStream&quot; protocol. Events are then dispatched to pipes
 * according to a given names. Here we consider that several stream of events
 * (independent one another) can be handled by the receiver. We thus introduce
 * the idea of <strong>stream ID</strong> where a stream is identified by an ID.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Receiver is composed of:
 * </p>
 * <ul class="simple">
 * <li>A socket server that handles multiples connections directed to multiple
 * streams (pipes). That part is mostly a copy/past from Antoine's &quot;MBox
 * Receiver&quot; code.</li>
 * <li>An implementation of the NetStream Protocol (see below) that parses the
 * received byte arrays and creates/sends graph events to specified pipes.</li>
 * <li>a set of streams (ThreadProxyPipes) identified by an ID. From
 * GraphStream's point of view, the NetStreamReceriver provides sources
 * (actually pipes) on which sinks (or other pipes) can connect to, to receive
 * graph events.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The Receiver's general behavior is:
 * </p>
 * <ul class="simple">
 * <li>Wait for messages from any sender received data is stored separately for
 * each sender until a message is completely received. The receiver knows about
 * a complete message because the first 4 bytes of the messages are an integer
 * that gives the size of the message.</li>
 * <li>A complete message is decoded (according to the NetStream Protocol), an
 * event is created and sent to the specified stream (pipe)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The graph event receiver listens at a given address and port. It runs on its
 * own thread. Several senders can connect to it, the receiver will demultiplex
 * the data flow and dispatch incoming events to specified pipes. No extra
 * thread are created when client connect.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * From the graph event stream point of view, the NetStream receiver can be seen
 * as a set of pipes identified by an id. When an event is received is is
 * directed to one specific stream. By default, senders not willing to handle
 * different streams may send to the stream called &quot;default&quot;.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The only way to receive events from the network is to ask for a stream by
 * means of a ThreadProxyPipe to the Receiver. The
 * <tt class="docutils literal">getStream()</tt> and
 * <tt class="docutils literal">getDefaultStream()</tt> give access to such
 * pipe. Asking a non-existing stream (with an unknown id) will create it, so
 * those functions always return a pipe. On the opposite, any new stream
 * introduced by a sender will be created by the receiver.
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * A sender, from the GraphStream API, is first of all a sink where one can plug

 * those messages to a defined receiver through a given <strong>port</strong>,
 * <strong>host</strong> and <strong>stream ID</strong>.

 * <h2>Data Types</h2>
 * <p>
 * Before sending a value whose type is unknown (integer, double, string,

 * server. Value types are defined to allow the server to recognize the type of
 * a value. When applicable (strings, tables, raw data) types are followed by a

 * represents the number of elements (for arrays).

 * <p>
 * the graph event, as created by a sender, is the third part of the whole sent

 * Then, other data depending on the event follow up. Those event identifiers
 * are one byte long. To avoid problems between languages (mainly because of
 * java) those bytes are unsigned and only positive values are used. So, any
