/**
 * Proxy pipe.
 *
 * <p>
 * A proxy is a kind of event buffer that allows to pass some kind of barrier.
 * The barrier can be a thread or a network for example. A proxy completely
 * decouple the source from the sink. The proxy buffers the source events and
 * when possible it sends them to the listeners at the sink. In other words, a
 * proxy is indirect, non synchronized and non blocking.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The usual source/sink mechanism is synchronized, direct and blocking : when
 * the event occurs, all listeners are called, and we have to wait they finish
 * to process these events to continue and send new events.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * With proxies, there is a buffer often compared to a mail box. Each event
 * produced as source is buffered and when the sink is free to receive these
 * events it can check the mail box and empty it, thus receiving the pending
 * events. This way of doing is completely non synchronized and non blocking
 * (due to the mail box).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This way of doing allows for example to pass a thread frontier with a minimum
 * of synchronization : only the mail box has to be synchronized. And the source
 * and sink can most of the time run in parallel. Without such a proxy, we would
 * have to synchronize the whole graph, and threads would consume their time
 * waiting one another since most of the work in GraphStream is centered on
 * graphs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For networks, this is the same thing : events are buffered before sending
 * them to the network. When the other end is ready it can check these events in
 * one operation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * However proxies have a limitation : they force the receiving end to check for
 * events regularly. This can be compared to "pumping" since the whole
 * GraphStream metaphor is a set of sources, pipes and sinks. Here instead of
 * flowing freely, the event stream must be pumped manually to receive it. This
 * is however most of the time not a problem since most work on graphs in
 * GraphStream is dynamic and runs iteratively.
 * </p>
