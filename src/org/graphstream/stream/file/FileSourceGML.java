/**
 * A GML parser.
 *
 * This parser should understand the whole GML syntax. It transforms any unknown
 * tag into an attribute. Depending on the location of the unknown tag, the
 * attribute is added to the graph, to nodes or to the edges.
 *
 * The "graphics" attributes are, as far as possible, transformed into
 * "ui.style" attributes that are merged with the style sheet. The understood
 * graphics tags are "x", "y", "z", "w", "h", "d" for position and size, "fill"
 * for the background color (becomes "fill-color"), "outline" (becomes
 * "stroke-color"), "type" (becomes "shape", the known shapes being the ones of
 * the GraphStream CSS, plus the "ellipse" tag wich maps to "circle" and the
 * "rectangle" tag that maps to "box"), "outline_width" (becomes "stroke-width",
 * in pixels).
 *
 * If edges have no "id" tag, the id is the concatenation of the source and
 * target node identifiers separated by a "_" character and a random number.
 *
 * You can declare nodes either with the full declaration:
 * <pre>
 * 		node [ Id "foo" ]
 * </pre> Which is useful when adding attributes to it. Or you can use a lighter
 * declaration with:
 * <pre>
 *      node "foo"
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can also remove nodes and edges by using:
 * <pre>
 *      -node "foo"
 *      del-node "foo"
 *      -node [ Id "foo" ]
 *      del-node [ Id "foo" ]
 * </pre> And the same for edges with "-edge" or "del-edge".
 *
 * All the dynamic events of GraphStream are supported as an extension.
 *
 * You can add or remove attributes to or from a node or edge using a minus sign
 * in front of the attribute name and following the attribute name by [].
 *
 * You can remove a node or edge using a minus sign in front of the node and
 * edge tags:
 * <pre>
 *     -node [ id "foo" ]
 * </pre> Or
 * <pre>
 *     -node "foo"
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can change the attributes of a node or edge using a plus sign in front of
 * the node and edge tags:
 * <pre>
 *     +node [ id "foo" someAttribute "added" -removedAttribute [] ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * Be careful, that files exported with the dynamic extensions will not be
 * compatible with most GML readers of other programs.
 *
 * The standard extension for GML files is ".gml". If your file contains dynamic
 * additions, you can use the ".dgml" (Dynamic GML) extensions. The parser will
 * handle both dynamic and non dynamic files with the extension ".gml".
