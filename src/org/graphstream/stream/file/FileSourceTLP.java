/**
 * Source for the Tulip file format (TLP).
 *
 * TLP files begins with :
 *
 * <pre>
 * (tlp "2.0"
 * ; file content
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * Some meta informations can be done :
 *
 * <pre>
 * (tlp "2.0"
 * 	(author "author name")
 *  (date "...")
 *  (comments "...")
 *  ...
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * Node indexes are integer. They can be declared in a "nodes" tag :
 *
 * <pre>
 * 	(tlp "2.0"
 * 		(nodes 1 2 3)
 *  	(edge 1 1 2)
 *  	(edge 2 1 3)
 *  	(edge 3 2 3)
 * 	)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then edge can be defined with an int index followed by the index of the
 * source node and the target nodes.
 *
 * Clusters can be created with an index and a name:
 * <pre>
 * 	(tlp "2.0"
 * 		(nodes 1 2 3)
 *  	(edge 1 1 2)
 *  	(edge 2 1 3)
 *  	(edge 3 2 3)
 *  	(cluster 1 "cluster name"
 *  		(nodes 1 3)
 *  		(edges 2)
 *  	)
 * 	)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Cluster 0 is the root graph.
 *
 * Properties can be applied to cluster:
 * <pre>
 * 	(tlp "2.0"
 * 		(nodes 1 2 3)
 *  	(edge 1 1 2)
 *  	(edge 2 1 3)
 *  	(edge 3 2 3)
 *  	(property cluster_id type "name"
 *  		(default "node_default" "edge_default")
 *  		(node node_id "value")
 *  		(edge edge_id "value")
 *  	)
 * 	)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Type of properties can be one of :
 * <ul>
 * <li>bool</li>
 * <li>double</li>
 * <li>int</li>
 * <li>string</li>
 * <li>color</li>
 * <li>layout</li>
 * <li>size</li>
 * </ul>
