/**
 * Source of graph events coming from a file.
 *
 * <p>
 * The file input interface is an input with specific methods that deals with
 * files. File inputs are designed to handle graphs stored under the form of a
 * textual or binary file either under the form of a file name or a Java input
 * stream. If the file comes from an URL, convert the URL to an input stream.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The file package is designed under the idea that it provides graph inputs
 * from files that store the graph under a given file format and encoding. The
 * package provides decoders for all these formats.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Do not confuse the file package with the net package that can also read from
 * URLs, but build graph not from encoded description of a graph, but from web
 * services like Flickr or Amazon, or simply networks of web pages tied by web
 * links. The graph construction task is entirely different.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although not all graph format handle dynamic graphs, all file inputs must
 * provide both the readAll() and begin()/nextEvents()/end() methods. The later
 * must read one graph modification at a time.
