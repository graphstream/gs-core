/**
 * Reader for the "edge" graph format.
 *
 * <p>
 * The edge graph format is a very simple and lightweight format where each line
 * describes an edge by giving two node names. The nodes are created implicitly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This reader also understands the derivative format where a line contains a
 * first node name, followed by several node names separated by spaces. In this
 * case it links the first node with all other node name following on the line.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Also, the format does not specify any direction for edges. By default all
 * edges are undirected. You can choose to make all edges directed by passing
 * "true" as the first arguments to constructors
 * {@link #FileSourceEdge(boolean)} or {@link #FileSourceEdge(boolean, boolean)}
 * . The direction of edges goes from the first node name on each line toward
 * the second (or more) node names on each line.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This format only contains edges. To ensure the "add node" events are sent
 * before an edge referencing two nodes is created via an "add edge" event, this
 * reader has a hash set of already encountered nodes. The hash set allows to
 * issue "add node" events only when a node is encountered for the first time.
 * </p>
 *
 * </p> This hash set consumes memory, but is the only way to ensure "add node"
 * events are correctly issued. If this input is directly connected to a graph,
 * as graphs can create non-existing nodes automatically, you can disable the
 * hash set of nodes using the constructor
 * {@link #FileSourceEdge(boolean, boolean)}, and giving "false" for the second
 * argument. </p>
 *
 * The usual file name extension for this format is ".edge".
