/**
 * Layout algorithm interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * The layout algorithm role is to compute the best possible positions of nodes
 * in a given space (2D or 3D) and eventually break points for edges if
 * supported using either aesthetic constraints, hierarchical constraints or
 * grouping constraints. As there are many such algorithms with distinct
 * qualities and uses, this interface defines what is awaited from a general
 * layout algorithm.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is a {@link Pipe} that receives notifications on the graph
 * eventually maintain an internal representation of it (or for some of them
 * work directly on the graph), and in return send graph events to give each
 * node a position via "xyz" attributes. Some algorithms may also export more
 * information for nodes and edges. For example some algorithms are also able to
 * work on the shape of an edge or the shape of a node.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The layout algorithm described by this interface may be iterative. Some
 * algorithm will compute directly their final representation of the graph in
 * one pass. However most algorithms will probably work step by step until a
 * global quality function is satisfied. This is the best way to handle evolving
 * graphs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This behavior has been chosen because this algorithm is often run aside the
 * main thread that works on the graph. We want a thread to be able to compute a
 * new layout on its side, without disturbing the main algorithm run on the
 * graph. See the {@link org.graphstream.ui.layout.LayoutRunner} for an helper
 * class allowing to create such a thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To be notified of the layout changes dynamically, you must register as a sink
 * of the layout.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The graph viewers in the UI package often use a layout algorithm to present
 * graphs on screen.
 * </p>
