/**
 * The GraphStream Spring-Box layout.
 *
 * <p>
 * This layout is the default GraphStream layout that handles dynamic graphs. It
 * can constantly evolve according to the changes in the graph. And works well
 * with the {@link LayoutRunner} class so that the computations stops when the
 * layout is stable enougth.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is based on the Frutcherman-Reingold force layout algorithm
 * modified on the attraction (the degree of nodes is taken into account to
 * stabilize the layout as we are not only interested in the result, but also in
 * the steps in between).
