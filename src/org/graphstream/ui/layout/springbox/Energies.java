/**
 * Represent the history of energy values for a force-based layout algorithm.
 *
 * <p>
 * The main intended usage is with the various force layout algorithms that use
 * a an "energy" minimization process to compute a layout. This class allows to
 * store the energy at a current step of layout computation and to remember a
 * history of such steps.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * At a current step of layout computation, one can accumulate energy in the
 * current cell of the energies buffer using {@link #accumulateEnergy(double)}.
 * When the step finishes, one calls {@link #storeEnergy()} to store this
 * accumulated energy in a cell of the memory, push a new cell on the memory and
 * therefore start a new step.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * At any time you can get the last energy value computed with
 * {@link #getEnergy()}. Be careful this is not the energy currently accumulated
 * but the value of the last energy stored with {@link #storeEnergy()}. You can
 * also get at any time the average energy in the memory with
 * {@link #getAverageEnergy()}, as well as an estimate of the stabilization (how
 * much the energies are varying) using {@link #getStabilization()}.
