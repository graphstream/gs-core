 * There are two rendering mechanisms in the Swing ui package : the viewer and
 * the renderers. The viewer is a complete architecture to render a graph in a
 * panel or frame, handling all the details. The renderer architecture is a way
 * to only render the graph in any surface, handled directly by the developer.
 * When using the render you are must handle the graphic graph by yourself, but
 * you have a lot more flexibility.
