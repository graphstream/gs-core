/**
 * Set of views on a graphic graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The viewer class is in charge of maintaining :
 * <ul>
 * <li>A "graphic graph" (a special graph that internally stores the graph under
 * the form of style sets of "graphic" elements, suitable to draw the graph, but
 * not to adapted to used it as a general graph),</li>
 * <li>The eventual proxy pipe from which the events come from (but graph events
 * can come from any kind of source),</li>
 * <li>A default view, and eventually more views on the graphic graph.</li>
 * <li>A flag that allows to repaint the view only if the graphic graph changed.
 * <li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graphic graph can be created by the viewer or given at construction (to
 * share it with another viewer).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <u>Once created, the viewer runs in a loop inside the Swing thread. You
 * cannot call methods on it directly if you are not in this thread</u>. The
 * only operation that you can use in other threads is the constructor, the
 * {@link #addView(View)}, {@link #removeView(String)} and the {@link #close()}
 * methods. Other methods are not protected from concurrent accesses.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some constructors allow a {@link ProxyPipe} as argument. If given, the
 * graphic graph is made listener of this pipe and the pipe is "pumped" during
 * the view loop. This allows to run algorithms on a graph in the main thread
 * (or any other thread) while letting the viewer run in the swing thread.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Be very careful: due to the nature of graph events in GraphStream, the viewer
 * is not aware of events that occured on the graph <u>before</u> its creation.
 * There is a special mechanism that replay the graph if you use a proxy pipe or
 * if you pass the graph directly. However, when you create the viewer by
 * yourself and only pass a {@link Source}, the viewer <u>will not</u> display
 * the events that occured on the source before it is connected to it.
 * </p>
