/**
 * An Interface that advises general purpose methods for handling graphs.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is one of the main interfaces of GraphStream. It defines the
 * services provided by a graph structure. Graphs implementations must at least
 * implement this interface (but are free to provide more services).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * With {@link org.graphstream.stream.Source},
 * {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink} and {@link org.graphstream.stream.Pipe},
 * this interface is one of the most important. A graph is a
 * {@link org.graphstream.stream.Pipe} that buffers the graph events and present
 * the graph structure as it is actually.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * In other words, it allows to browse the graph structure, to explore it, to
 * modify it, and to implement algorithms on it. This class can be seen as a
 * snapshot of a stream of event at current time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * With factories ({@link org.graphstream.graph.NodeFactory},
 * {@link org.graphstream.graph.EdgeFactory}), users can define their own models
 * of nodes or edges. Problem is that when you define such model, you want to
 * access to elements with the valid type, without cast if possible. To improve
 * the access to elements in such cases, Graph offers implicit genericity to
 * access nodes or edges. The following is an example of an access without
 * genericity :
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * 	Graph g = ... ;
 * 	g.setNodeFactory( new MyNodeFactory() );
 *  g.addNode("root");
 *
 *  MyNode n = (MyNode) g.getNode("root");
 *
 *  for( Node o : g.getEachNode() )
 *  {
 *  	MyNode node = (MyNode) o;
 *  	// Do something with node
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * With implicit genericity offers by Graph, this can be done easier:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *  Graph g = ... ;
 * 	g.setNodeFactory( new MyNodeFactory() );
 *  g.addNode("root");
 *
 *  MyNode n = g.getNode("root");
 *
 *  for( MyNode node : g.getEachNode() )
 *  {
 *  	// Do something with node
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Graph elements (nodes and edges) can be accessed using their identifier or
 * their index. Each node / edge has a unique string identifier assigned when
 * the element is created. Each element has an automatically maintained unique
 * index between 0 and {@link #getNodeCount()} - 1 or {@link #getEdgeCount()} -
 * 1. When a new element is added, its index is <code>getNodeCount() - 1</code>
 * or <code>getEdgeCount() - 1</code>. When an element is removed, the element
 * with the biggest index takes its place. Unlike identifiers, indices can
 * change when the graph is modified, but they are always successive. A loop of
 * the form
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; g.getNodeCount(); i++) {
 * 	Node node = g.getNode(i);
 * 	// Do something with node
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * will always iterate on all the nodes of <code>g</code>.
 * </p>

	 * The behavior of this method depends on many conditions. It can be

	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <p>
	 * First of all, the method checks if the graph already contains an edge
	 * with the same id. If this is the case and strict checking is enabled,
	 * {@code IdAlreadyInUseException} is thrown. If the strict checking is
	 * disabled the method returns a reference to the existing edge if it has
	 * endpoints {@code node1} and {@code node2} (in the same order if the edge
	 * is directed) or {@code null} otherwise.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <p>
	 * In the case when the graph does not contain an edge with the same id, the
	 * method checks if {@code node1} and {@code node2} exist. If one or both of
	 * them do not exist, and strict checking is enabled, {@code
	 * ElementNotFoundException} is thrown. Otherwise if auto-creation is
	 * disabled, the method returns {@code null}. If auto-creation is enabled,
	 * the method creates the missing endpoints.
	 * <p>
	 * <p>
	 * When the edge id is not already in use and the both endpoints exist (or
	 * created), the edge can still be rejected. It may happen for example when
	 * it connects two already connected nodes in a single graph. If the edge is
	 * rejected, the method throws {@code EdgeRejectedException} if strict
	 * checking is enabled or returns {@code null} otherwise. Finally, if the
	 * edge is accepted, it is created using the corresponding edge factory and
	 * a reference to it is returned.
	 * <p>
	 * <p>
	 * An edge creation event is sent toward the listeners. If new nodes are
	 * created, the corresponding events are also sent to the listeners.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is implicitly generic and return something which extends
	 * Edge. The return type is the one of the left part of the assignment. For
	 * example, in the following call :
	 * <p>
	 * <pre>
	 * ExtendedEdge e = graph.addEdge(&quot;...&quot;, &quot;...&quot;, &quot;...&quot;);
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * the method will return an ExtendedEdge. If no left part exists, method
	 * will just return an Edge.
