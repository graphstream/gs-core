 <p>
 The NetStream framework allows to export the idea of &quot;streams of graph
 events&quot; to other languages than Java, through a network interface. The
 aim is mainly to allow the use of GraphStream with other projects written in
 other languages. However, since it is a network interface it also allows the
 use of several machines. The protocol is optimized to be have as low overhead
 as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
 If you are looking for a Java-to-Java network link between GraphStream and
 some other project, you may prefer GraphStream's
 <a class="reference external" href="http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/Using-remote-source_1.0/">RMI</a> facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
 This document is organized in 3 sections. The first one details the
 Receiver's mechanisms. The second section describes the Sender. The last
 section details the NetStream Protocol.
 </p>
 <div class="section" id="receiver">
 <h1>Receiver</h1>
 <p>
 This one is responsible for receiving graph events from the network following
 the &quot;NetStream&quot; protocol. Events are then dispatched to pipes
 according to a given names. Here we consider that several stream of events
 (independent one another) can be handled by the receiver. We thus introduce
 the idea of <strong>stream ID</strong> where a stream is identified by an ID.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Receiver is composed of:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
 <li>A socket server that handles multiples connections directed to multiple
 streams (pipes). That part is mostly a copy/past from Antoine's &quot;MBox
 Receiver&quot; code.</li>
 <li>An implementation of the NetStream Protocol (see below) that parses the
 received byte arrays and creates/sends graph events to specified pipes.</li>
 <li>a set of streams (ThreadProxyPipes) identified by an ID. From
 GraphStream's point of view, the NetStreamReceriver provides sources
 (actually pipes) on which sinks (or other pipes) can connect to, to receive
 graph events.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 The Receiver's general behavior is:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
 <li>Wait for messages from any sender received data is stored separately for
 each sender until a message is completely received. The receiver knows about
 a complete message because the first 4 bytes of the messages are an integer
 that gives the size of the message.</li>
 <li>A complete message is decoded (according to the NetStream Protocol), an
 event is created and sent to the specified stream (pipe)</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 The graph event receiver listens at a given address and port. It runs on its
 own thread. Several senders can connect to it, the receiver will demultiplex
 the data flow and dispatch incoming events to specified pipes. No extra
 thread are created when client connect.
 </p>
 <p>
 From the graph event stream point of view, the NetStream receiver can be seen
 as a set of pipes identified by an id. When an event is received is is
 directed to one specific stream. By default, senders not willing to handle
 different streams may send to the stream called &quot;default&quot;.
 </p>
 <p>
 The only way to receive events from the network is to ask for a stream by
 means of a ThreadProxyPipe to the Receiver. The
 <tt class="docutils literal">getStream()</tt> and
 <tt class="docutils literal">getDefaultStream()</tt> give access to such
 pipe. Asking a non-existing stream (with an unknown id) will create it, so
 those functions always return a pipe. On the opposite, any new stream
 introduced by a sender will be created by the receiver.
 </p>

 <h1>Sender</h1>
 <p>
 A sender, from the GraphStream API, is first of all a sink where one can plug
 sources so that it can receive events. Receiving these events the sender will
 pack them into messages according to the NetStream Protocol and then send
 those messages to a defined receiver through a given <strong>port</strong>,
 <strong>host</strong> and <strong>stream ID</strong>.

 <h1>The NetStream Protocol</h1>
 <p>
 Messages in the NetStream protocol are specified a the byte level. It is
 different than an XML-based protocols like client/server REST approaches.
 Here the content and different formats constituting a message are optimize as
 much as possible, so as to reduce the network payload.
 </p>
 <p>
 A message, as it is created by a sender, is composed of three main parts:
 <ol class="arabic simple">
 <li>A 4 bytes integer that indicates the size (in bytes) of the remaining of
 this message (not including those 4 bytes).</li>
 <li>A string, encoded using the NetStream protocol (see
 <tt class="docutils literal">TYPE_STRING</tt> below), that identifies the
 stream targeted by this event.</li>

 protocol.</li>

 <h2>Data Types</h2>
 <p>
 Before sending a value whose type is unknown (integer, double, string,
 array...) one have to specify its type (and if applicable, its length) to the
 server. Value types are defined to allow the server to recognize the type of
 a value. When applicable (strings, tables, raw data) types are followed by a
 length. This length is always coded with a 16-bits signed short and usually
 represents the number of elements (for arrays).

 <h2>Graph Events</h2>
 <p>
 the graph event, as created by a sender, is the third part of the whole sent
 message. It is made of several parts that differ according the event. The
 common information is the first byte of the event, that identifies the event.
 Then, other data depending on the event follow up. Those event identifiers
 are one byte long. To avoid problems between languages (mainly because of
 java) those bytes are unsigned and only positive values are used. So, any
 event identifier will take a value between 0 and 127.
