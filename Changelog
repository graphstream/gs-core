December 19 2009, antoinedutot
	* Moved GraphListenerProxy, GraphListenerProxyThread and GraphListenerProxyCopy into the ui
	  package. These classes are now used only by the old viewer and replaced by io.ProxyPipe.
	* The old viewer is still usable, although it does not use completely the new architecture.

*** Bon le dernier changement date de juillet 2009 ... il me semble que l'API a changé entre temps :-) ***

July 15 2009, antoinedutot
	* Added the io2 package that will provide the new I/O mechanism that is everywhere in GS.
	* The io2 package will become io when ready.
	* Changed Graph so that it is a Filter from the I/O package.
	* Added the ui2 package that will provide an almost complete rewrite of the graphstream
	  viewing capabilities with :
	  	* A graphic graph that respect the new I/O mechanism.
	  	* A new style sheet language that is more orthogonal. 
	  	* A new style group mechanism that should improve a lot drawing by grouping elements with
	  	  the same style to draw them at once in bulk operations.
	  	* A new and hopefully simpler "sprite" mechanism that should avoid using the GraphViewerRemote.
	  	* A simpler architecture for threads.
	  	* Some technical documentation for developers of the UI package !! (with a justification
	  	  of the choices made :-)) (see the HowItWorks files).
	
	* Added a (subtle!) change to the AbstractElement : when an attribute value is changed, if
	  the old value and the new values are the same, the "attributeChanged" event is not issued.
	  This will improve efficiency, and will avoid recursion problems when two graphs are
	  synchronised via the I/O mechanism.

March 22 2009, antoinedutot
	* Finally commited the new GraphListener mechanism. There are three interfaces:
		- GraphElementsListener (for listening at elements changes (node, edges, steps).
		- GraphAttributesListener (for listenering at attributes changes).
		- GraphListener that inherit the two above.
	* The graph interface now respect these listeners.
	* Also un-deprecated the Graph.getNodeSet() Graph.getEdgeSet(), Node.getEdgeSet(), Element.getAttributeKeySet(), etc.
	  so that they return an Iterable instead of a set. This allows to use the for-each statement
	  and do not allow to modify the returned sets. 
	

March 09 2009, gsavin
	* Add a reader for Tulip file format.

February 27 2009, gsavin:
	* Refactoring of org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.IncompleteGridGenerator.
	This class a now a Generator, but can still generate DGS in the same way that before.

February 26 2009, gsavin:
	* Update all licence preambles of the gs-core package.
	* Remove all @author tags from sources.

February 23 2009, gsavin:
	* Remove setId() method from Element. id becomes a final value set at
	object creation.
	* Remove setGraph() method from Node. graph becomes a final value set at
	object creation
	* Remove setNode[01]() from *Edge.. n0 and n1 become final values set at
	object creation.

January 8 2008:
	* Correct some bugs in the display(boolean) method of AdjacencyListGraph.
	* Add a thread-safe graph : ConcurrentGraph
	  - AbstractConcurrentElement
	  - ConcurrentNode
	  - ConcurrentNodeFactory
	  - ConcurrentEdge
	  - ConcurrentEdgeFactory
	  - ConcurrentGraph

January 3 2008:
	* Added some important modifications to the I/O package, trying to preserve the backward
	  compatibility ;-)
	  	* The various readers can have now a version of begin() and read() that takes a
	  	  java.io.Reader as argument in addition to the java.io.InputStream and String arguments.
	  	* The readers and writers are now able to handle attribute removal. To do this the Reader
	  	  can now register a GraphReaderListenerExtended in addition to the usual
	  	  GraphReaderListeners. This extended listener can handle more finely attributes and is
	  	  able to add them as well as remove them for dynamic graphs.
	  	* All the readers have been updated to handle such listeners in addition to the usual ones.
	  	* This should not cause any difference in the old code, excepted for implementors of the
	  	  GraphReader interface.
	  	* The GraphWriter interface has been changed to handle two new writing methods that allows
	  	  to add or remove individual attributes to node, edges and graphs. This introduces an
	  	  incompatibility in the rare code blocks that implement GraphWriter.
	  		- The while i/o package.
	  		- The Flickr sub-project.
	  		- The Amazon Crawler sub-project.
	* Added a new kind of attribute handled automatically : hashes. Previously the String, Number
	  and array types where recognised only. Now hashes are also handled.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Element.
	* Added a "graph.Attribute" interface. An attribute is an object that can be converted to a
	  hash.
	* Introduced the version 004 of the DGS format.
		* This format allows to remove attributes in a "change node" (cn) and "change edge" (ce)
		  by putting a '-' sign before the name of the attribute. The "+" sign is also supported
		  but not necessary.
	  	* Also added the hability to read and write hashes in DGS 4, the syntax for a
	  	  hash attribute is a:[i:value j:value: k:value]. These hashes can be nested :
	  	  a:[b:[c:value]], etc.
	  		- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDGS,
	  		- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterDGS.
	* Added the "junit.jar" dependency in the "lib/" directory.
	* Added the start of some automated testing in I/O and UI2 using JUnit.

August 31 2008:
	* Corrected a quite mould bug : The DGS writer was not able to export directed graphs ... The
	  directed flag was ignored ... ah ah ah ...

August 29 2008:
	* The node and edge identifiers are added to the SVG output so it is possible to write a SVG CSS
	  that defines styles for individual elements with the GraphWriterSVG.

August 28 2008:
	* Added a SVG output in org.miv.graphstream.io as GraphWriterSVG. This output is different from
	  the SVG output provided by the graph viewer since it does not need a viewer. However it
	  does not yet support CSS and will probably never support sprites (as they are specific to
	  the graph viewer).
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterSVG,
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.test.TestGraphWriterSVG,
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.test.TestGraphWriterSVG2.

	* Finally added a LayoutAlgorithm class that allows to run a layout easily without having to
	  open a graph viewer. The layout algorithm takes as argument a graph and a Layout
	  implementation. Then it allows to compute a layout and store "xyz" attributes in the graph.
	  
	  This should also way faster than the layout used in the viewer since there is no inter-thread
	  communication, and graphic output.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout2.LayoutAlgorithm,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.test.TestGraphWriterSVG2 (for an usage example). 

August 6 2008:
	* Added several CSS new properties:
		- "text-mode" with values: "normal", "truncated", "hidden", with hidden that allows to
		  completely hide the text label, and truncated that allows to truncate the label to
		  20 characters.
		- Shadows:
			- "shadow-style", with values "none" or "simple", this enables shadows.
			- "shadow-width", with numeric value, the shadow has the form and size of the element,
			  plus this width.
			- "shadow-offset", with two numeric values for the x and y offsets.
			- "shadow-color", a colour list, for simple shadows, only the first colour is used.
		- Actually shadows are only implemented for circle or square nodes. This is a test.
	* See org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.test.TestShadows.

August 1 2008:
	* Add Frederic's dynamic random graph generator:
	 	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.RandomFixedDegreeDynamicGraphGenerator
	* Add  a void implementation of GraphListener:
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.GraphListenerHelper 
		
July 31 2008:
	* Move org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Nervousness to  
	org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.measure.ElementNervousness
	* New measurements class: GraphNervousness
	
July 30 2008:
	* Add the "stepBegins" event to the GraphListener interface. Warning, this implies a lot of
	modifications. 
	* Add a generator of incomplete graph grids.
		- org.miv;graphstream.generator.IncompleteGridGenerator
		
July 28 2008:
	* Improve parseFromURL() method of StyleSheet to support files.

July 16 2008:
	* Add a parseFromURL method to StyleSheet which will be used in GraphicGraph to
	load file or url.

July 15 2008:
	* Added utility methods in Algorithms (graph.algorithm()) to get the position of a node more
	  easily and to compute edge lengths.

July 11 2008:
	* The "ui.state" attribute is now working. It allows to specify arbitrary "meta classes" in
	  style sheets. For example : "node:foo { color: red; } node:bar { color: blue }". Then you
	  can put an attribute on nodes : "n.addAttribute( "ui.state", "foo" );".
	  
	  This is mechanism works almost the same as classes but overrides it. This means that a
	  meta class will always have more precedence than a class (though they aggregate). It
	  will be easier later on to add more events that hook on these meta classes (in addition
	  to "clicked").
	  
	* Add a "for each" command in CLI.	For example: 
	for each $I in {1,2,3} do add node "feuille$I" ; add edge "edge$I" "root" "feuille$I"
	* Add a "for" command in CLI. For example:
	for $I from 0 to 100 do add node "feuille$I" ; add edge "edge$I" "root" "feuille$I"
	* CLITerm uses a css stylesheet (org/miv/graphstream/tool/workbench/cliterm.css).
	* Prompt gains focus when cliterm window gains focus.

July 10 2008:
	* Add delete actions in workbench.
	* Action accessories work !

July 09 2008:
	* Add action accessories in workbench (just to look for the moment)
	* Fix a bug when deleting nodes/edges in the selection list

July 07 2008:
	* Add an accessor for the SwingGraphViewer's context.
	* Can select nodes in workbench by a click.
	* Can select edges in workbench by double-clicking on a node and use the wheel to iterate
	on edges.
	* Can add nodes and edges by clicking on the graph.

July 05:
	* Added meta-classes to style sheets. The two first meta classes provided
	  are ":clicked" and ":selected". They provide styles that are automatically
	  "aggregated" to the current style of an element (replacing only style properties
	  that are set in the ":clicked" or ":selected" style) when some event occurs.
	  
	  The event for ":clicked" maps to mouse clicks on elements (sprites and nodes only
	  as graphs and edges are not clickable).
	  
	  The event for ":selected" is associated to the addition or removal of the "ui.selected"
	  attribute to the corresponding node or edge.
	  
	* More globally, added "alternate" styles to the style class. This mechanism allows
	  to "extend" a style by aggregation with one or more other styles when some "events"
	  are activated. The aggregation mechanism works the same as for multiple classes
	  on a given element.
	  
	* See org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.test.TestStyleEvents.
	  
July 04 2008:
	* Add a new graph interface in workbench.
	* Add cli commands to set or unset attributes (fully regex!).

July 03 2008:
	* Improve select CLI command: can use pattern to select nodes or edges
		'select all nodes "n[0-9]"'
	* Improve open interface and add save interface in workbench.
	* Add a CLI command to enable/disable autolayout
	* Add WorkbenchUtils to store usual graphical actions.

July 2 2008:
	* The style sheet mechanism now is able to put several classes for one element.

July 01 2008:
	* Add list commands to workbench
	  - list [nodes|edges] "pattern"
	  - list [node|edge] "id"
	* Add copy/paste to workbench.
	* Add open interface in workbench.

June 30 2008:
	* Add GraphInfo box in WorkbenchGUI. it is able to display current context
	and informations about graph which defines this context.
	* Add a SelectionTree which displays selected elements and their attributes.
	* Add a CLI logo.
	* Add a node and an edge icons.
	* Add a new listener, SelectionListener, which defines objects listening to the
	context's selection list.
	* Add selection commands (SelectOperators).
	* Change display style to a 'gimp' display.

June 28 2008:
	* WorkbenchGUI is able to display GraphViewer with the CLI command "create graph".

June 27 2008:
	* Change the CLI commands architecture, adding a new class CLICommand
	which will define a command. Add three commands:
		- NodeOperations: add and remove nodes
		- EdgeOperations: add and remove edges
		- GraphOperations: create, open, display, select, list graphs.
	The CLI is fully regex-based. All is in "org.miv.graphstream.workbench.cli".
	* Begin the Workbench GUI. Can find in "org.miv.graphstream.workbench.gui".

June 26 2008:
	* Add an abstract class to implements spanning tree algorithms
	* Add the Kruskal's algorithm
	* Add the Prim's algorithm
	* Add a short tuto about spanning tree algorithms
	
	* Added the start of multi-point edge implementation in the style-sheet and in the graph viewer. It is
	   possible to specify the points of an edge using the "edge-shape" property in the style sheet:
	   		edge { edge-shape: (1,2,3), (4,5,6); }
	   For this to work, there must be no automatic layout algorithm. 
	   
	* Add the beginning of a workbench project. 
	   A command line interpreter is running, using the WorkbenchCore class.
	* Fix a bug in GraphFactory ( split(".") --> split("[.]") because of regex )

June 3 2008:
	* It is now possible to call Graph.removeGraphListener() in a graph listener !
	* The GraphViewer.close() operation now correctly remove the listeners from the graph.

May 23 2008:
	* Edge borders are now drawn.
	* The graph can have a border that is drawn.
	* A new style sheet property appears : "padding". It allows to put padding around some
	  elements. Actually, only the graph rule can understand it. It allows to put padding around
	  the whole graph rendering.
	* Finally changed the names of the predefined attributes used by the graph viewer and the
	  default layout algorithm. Graphic attributes are prefixed by "ui." and layout attributes are
	  prefixed by "layout.".
	  	- color       becomes  ui.color
	  	- width       becomes  ui.width
	  	- stylesheet  becomes  ui.stylesheet
	  	- style       becomes  ui.style
	  	- hide        becomes  ui.hide
	  	- force       becomes  layout.force
	  	- weight      becomes  layout.weight
	  Other attributes like "x", "y", "z", "xy", "xyz", and "label" are not prefixed since they
	  are used in several places and are not layout or graphic specific.
	  THE OLD NAMES WILL CONSERVE THEIR MEANING UNTIL VERSION 0.4.9. For the next release 0.5.0,
	  the prefixed versions will have to be used.
	* Updated the manual and tutorials accordingly. 

May 15 2008:
	* Nodes, edges and sprites can now be hidden individually in the GraphViewer display using the
	  "ui.hide" attribute. Merely add the attribute without value to hide an element. Remove the
	  attribute to make it visible anew.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer, 
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingNodeRenderer, 
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingEdgeRenderer.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.test.TestHide. 

May 12 2008:
	* Edges can now have borders in the GraphViewer.
	* Added the sketch of a graph editor. Not yet usable.

May 11 2008:
	* Corrected a bug in the graph viewer that prevented multi-edges that go in different
	  direction to be drawn correctly.
	* There was still bugs in the ElasticBox (bugs moisis).
	* Polished the ShowGraph utility and re-added the ability to control the flow of events when
	  "playing" a dynamic graph. Added the ability to clear, load and accumulate (cascade) CSS
	  files. Also provided several "predefined" style sheets.

May 9 2008:
	* Corrected a lot of bugs in the GraphViewer* and ElasticBox* things.
	* The swing graph viewer now centre the view.
	* The ElasticBox now stops when the global layout energy stabilises.

April 27 2008:
	* The Swing graph viewer now can draw multi-edges. There is a restriction however :
	  the cubic-curve and angle styles are not supported. Loop edges also support multi-edges.
	* It remains a bug with arrows on loop edges when pointing at text-box or text-ellipse nodes. 

April 26 2008:
	* Cubic-curve evaluator in ui.swing.Context.
	* Arrows are now correctly oriented when drawn on cubic-curve edges.
	* The swing renderer know is able to correctly compute the arrow position for text-box
	  and text-ellipse nodes (still not perfect, though).
	! There is still a bug however when the arrow is on a cubic-curve edge.
	* Sprites are now correctly positioned on cubic-curve edges.
	* The flow sprite can now be curved and follows the edge shape.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingEdgeRenderer,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingSpriteRenderer,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.Context.
	* The code is ready to draw multi-edges using cubic curves, but this is not enabled yet.

April 19 2008:
	* Changed the GraphReaderWeb so that it can restrict its search to some sites. This allows to
	  parse sites of the same domain or in a set of domains for example. Corrected a bug in the
	  GraphReaderWeb that made it generate trees only. Now it generates
	  graphs. Added weights on edges created by the GraphReaderWeb.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderWeb.
	* Added a tool that allows to create graphs from blogs.
		- org.miv.graphstream.tool.BlogFerret.

April 18 2008:
	* Corrected several bugs in the "elastic-box" graph layout. Added several tests.
	* Added a tool that allows to save connected components of a graph to separate files.
		- org.miv.graphstream.tool.SaveConnectedComponents.
	* Added a basic tool that allows to show graphs.
		- org.miv.graphstream.tool.ShowGraph.

April 13 2008:
	* Added a MultiGraph, MultiNode and MultiEdge multi-graph implementation. The multi-graph
	  allows several edges between two nodes. MultiGraph inherits DefaultGraph, MultiNode
	  inherits DefaultNode and MultiEdge inherits DefaultEdge. The last two are made abstract to
	  allow the creation of a SingleGraph. This sould not break any old code.

	* Created a SingleGraph, SingleNode and SingleEdge that inherit DefaultGraph, DefaultNode
	  and DefaultEdge. The use of DefaultGraph is the same as before, and SingleGraph work the
	  same as DefaultGraph (this is only a renaming of DefaultGraph).
	  
	  The inheritance hierarchy is the following:
	  
	  DefaultGraph
	    |
	    +--- SingleGraph (the same as DefaultGraph)
	    |
	    +--- MultiGraph (adds the ability to have several edges between two nodes)
	    
	  DefaultNode (abstract)
	    |
	    +--- SingleNode (ensure there is always at most one edge between two nodes)
	    |
	    +--- MultiGraph (allows several edges between two nodes)
	    
	  DefaultEdge (abstract)
	    |
	    +--- SingleEdge (ensure no other edge has the same sources and destination)
	    |
	    +--- MultiEdge (allows other edges to have both the same sources and destination)
	    
	  Both MultiGraph/Edge/Node and SingleGraph/Edge/Node share a lot of code in common.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultGraph,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultNode,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultEdge,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.SingleGraph,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.SingleNode,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.SingleEdge,

	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.MultiNode,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.MultiEdge.
	  	
	* The graph viewer does not yet draw correctly multi-edges, but supports them.
	  	
	* Added a better test base for graphs, which will allow to do (poor) regression
	  tests. This is not ideal, but at least it exists.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.test.TestBase,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.test.TestBasic,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.test.TestIterators,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.test.TestMultiGraph.
	  	
	* All these classes probably need a lot more polishing and testing.

April 02 2008:
	* It is now possible to specify node positions using attributes "xy" and "xyz" in addition
	  of the old way using "x", "y" and "z". This is made possible by the new addAttribute()
	  method that can take a variable list of arguments. In this case the value is an array
	  of objects containing the two or three coordinates.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicNode.
	  	
	* Added the start of a FAQ in the web site.
	
	* Added a tutorial on node positioning and interaction with the mouse in the
	  graph viewer.

March 31 2008:
	* Release 0.4.0

March 29 2008:
	* Finished the tutorial on "sprites", added a tutorial on graph reading and writing.
	
	* Added a DynamicGraphWriterHelper, a class that listen at a graph and writes back all the
	  events occurring on the graph to a file. There was already a GraphWriterHelper but it was
	  only able to take a snap shot of a graph at a given time.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.DynamicGraphWriterHelper.
	  	
	* Added a Element.addAttribute(String,Object ... values) that allows to add arrays as attributes
	  easily. Done the same with sprites.
	  
	* It is now possible to specify several colours after the "color:" styling element in style
	  sheets. This will ultimately allow gradients and can already be used to specify several
	  colours for multicolour elements like pie-charts.

March 28 2008:
	* Updated the manual : the DGS description is up to date, the installation instructions
	  are updated, the SVN usage is specified, the IO package description is corrected.
	* The JavaDoc now has far less warnings, tags are OK.
	* Renamed (anew) the SimpleGraph into its (we hope) final name : DefaultGraph.
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultGraph,
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultNode,
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultEdge,
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultNodeFactory,
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultEdgeFactory.
	* A long awaited feature : it is now possible to remove elements using iterators on the
	  node and edge set of the graph (graph.getNodeIterator() and graph.getEdgeIterator()).
	  The other iterators (in the Node class) do not yet allow removing. Would it be useful ?
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.DefaultGraph.

March 27 2008:
	* New sprite shapes available: flow, text-box, text-ellipse, pie-chart.
	* The complete bounds of nodes is used to fit the graph in the viewer window and ensure all is
	  visible, not only the node centre. Consequently the border around the drawing passed from 30
	  pixels to 5 pixels.
	* "loop" edges, that is edges that leave and enter the same node, are now drawn.

March 26 2008:
	* Added and changed tutorials, figures, explanations, etc.
	* Changed the sprite API of the GraphViewerRemote. The remote now produces Sprite objects that
	  can be manipulated in a more object-oriented way. The old sprite API of GraphViewerRemote
	  is still here but its use is discouraged since it is function-oriented.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphViewerRemote,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.Sprite.
	* The sprites can now be positioned using chosen units, either graph units, percents or
	  pixels.
	* Specified the API docs for sprite positioning using either polar or spherical coordinates,
	  as well as the units in which lengths and radii are specified.
	* Added two small logos in the doc/web/pix directory that are generated using the GraphStream
	  viewer. They now decorate pages in the HTML doc. One is a Moebius band, the other is a
	  flow.
	* There is now a big quality difference between rendering quality levels 3 and 4. They are
	  both anti-aliased, but the level 4 renders shapes with sub-pixel accuracy. This avoids
	  integer positioning of elements that was quite displeasing, particularly for sprites.

March 20 2008:
	* Added units to lengths in style sheets. The two possible units are "gu" for "Graph Units",
	  and "px" for "PiXels". It should be easy to add percents (of the graph width or height).
	  See org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.test.TestStyles3 for an example.

March 19 2008:
	* Finally removed the old UI package to replace it by the new UI2 package (that was renamed UI,
	  thus).
	* Fixed the graph coordinate system as being "right-handed". This means that the Y positive
	  axis goes up and the Z positive axis goes "out of the screen".
	* Added the possibility to move nodes with the mouse in the new swing graph viewer.
	* Added a mechanism that allows to put a GraphViewerListener on a graph viewer using the
	  GraphViewerRemote. This allows to avoid any thread contention and is quite easy. Now it is
	  easy to listen at actions done by the user in the graph view (like selecting nodes, moving
	  them, the same for sprites, etc.).
	* It is not yet possible to move sprites using the mouse : the constraints on attaching sprites
	  to edges and nodes makes it difficult.

March 14 2008:
	* Added a GraphReaderListenerWriter. The goal of this class is to send to a
	  writer all the events coming from a graph reader. This allows to easily
	  convert a graph from a format into another.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderListenerWriter.

March 9 2008:
	* Added the z-index specifier in style sheets. It is now possible to draw nodes, edges or
	  sprites above or under others.
	* Changed the tutorial index. Added some tutorials, and started to edit them. A LOT OF
	  WORK IS STILL NEEDED HERE.

March 8 2008:
	* Added arrow shapes, width and length, and various bugs corrections. Re-added the cubic
	  curve style to the edge shapes.

March 7 2008:
	* The style sheet mechanism is now much more complete. Basic style, shape, colours, borders,
	  fonts, text styles, text alignment, edges arrows, etc. are now working.
	* Sprites : A new mechanism has been added to append graphics to the graph display. This
	  allows to put arbitrary graphic elements everywhere in the graph space. Sprites can also
	  be attached to nodes or edges. In this case, their positioning is modified so that it
	  is easy to make a sprite orbit around a node or travel along edges. TODO it remains some
	  work so that  the edge positioning uses polar coordinates.
	  Sprites, like nodes or edge support arbitrary attributes.
	  	org.miv.graphstream.ui2.graphicGraph.Sprite, 
	  	org.miv.graphstream.ui2.graphicGraph.SpriteManager, 
	  	org.miv.graphstream.ui2.GraphViewerRemote.
	* Sprites can be styled using style sheets like nodes or edges. It is now easy to specify
	  an image or label on sprites, and to change many aspects of their rendering.
	* Several bugs corrected in the way the graph viewer avoid to redisplay an unchanged graph.
	  The viewer must now be far less CPU intensive.
	* Corrected several bugs in the ElasticBox force-based graph layout implementation.

February 23 2008:
	* The Swing graph rendering component in ui2.swing is now able to read basic styles from the
	  style sheet. A lot of work is still needed to :
	  	- correctly interpret the styles by doing nice graphics ;
	  	- augment the vocabulary of the style sheet.

February 22 2008:
	* Added a ui.graphicGraph.stylesheet package that contains the definition of a style sheet,
	  styles for nodes, edges and graphs (and more!), a style sheet parser made using javacc (and
	  therefore requiring no external packages to run (naturally javacc is needed to produce
	  the parser, which is needed only when the .jj file is changed).
	  
	  The style sheet follows CSS rules and as most as possible use the CSS syntax. However the
	  elements are not HTML elements (which is not a necessity in CSS), but elements of a graph
	  (node, edge, graph, and more). The cascading is "almost" :-) respected.
	  
	  Naturally the style elements are not only CSS (for example "arrow-style"). Actually there
	  are few styles that can be set. 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.stylesheet.*.
	  	
	  Naturally this is absolutely not useful and furthermore not used in the drawing classes !!
	  :-) (yet)

February 21 2008:
	* Corrected several bugs in ElasticBox. The default layout should be much more stable (and
	  smooth). The way the temperature is handled is still buggy. It temperature cool factor
	  should take into account the size of the graph (in nodes count) ?
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.elasticBox.ElasticBox.
	  Added a ui2.swing package to test ideas on the new UI. It works, but needs a lot of work !
	  The main idea is to add CSS style sheets to customise the display.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui2.swing.*.

February 20 2008:
	* Added a new ui package named with originality ui2 that will allow to clean ui. The first
	  and actually unique class of this package is GraphViewerBase. GraphViewer, GraphViewerListener
	  and GraphViewerListenerProxy that are actually in the graph package should also do the move
	  to ui2 as soon as possible.

	  The new GraphViewerBase class defines the base implementation of a GraphViewer. It allows to
	  connect to a graph in a thread A, run a layout in a thread B and display the graph in a thread
	  C. In this C thread a GraphicGraph instance reflect the state of the A graph and the positions
	  computed in the B thread. The graph viewer allows with one method call to reflect the positions
	  computed by the layout in B to the graph in A. It also allows A to send commands to the layout
	  (set the force, the quality, etc.). It allows also with a single method to register listeners
	  for graphical events like a click on a node, on the background or a node moved by the mouse.
	  
	  It can be used by anybody that want to create a graph renderer, all the ugly work of
	  synchronising the data is done. Rendering a graph is as simple as reading the graphic graph.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui2.GraphViewerBase.

February 19 2008:
	* Added a GraphListenerProxy in the graph package. The proxy allows to listen at a graph across
	  threads boundaries. The proxy even allows to create and maintain an exact copy of the graph in
	  another thread (the two graph can pertain to a different graph implementation, for example
	  a GraphicGraph can be the copy of a SimpleGraph).
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.GraphListenerProxy.
	* GraphicGraph, GraphicNode and GraphicEdge now implement (partially) Graph, Node and Edge.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicGraph,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicNode,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicEdge.

February 18 2008:
	* Removed the qtviewer and ogl packages from ui. They are now in a separate project.
	  This will make GraphStream lighter : it will now depend only on Swing.
	* The SimpleGraph class (and SimpleNode and SimpleEdge) now support loop edges (whose source
	  and target point to the same node).
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.SimpleGraph,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.SimpleNode,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.implementations.SimpleEdge.

February 17 2008:
	* Moved the SimpleGraph and AdjacencyListGraph implementations and the various attached classes
	  to a graphs package besides org.miv.graphstream.graph. This allows to have a basic graph
	  package much more clear, and will allow to define new graph class in a cleaner way.
	* The graph package is no more dependent on the ui package. The goal is to remove this complex
	  ui package, keeping only the swing viewer to conserve basic functionality. The ui will then
	  be provided by a stand alone library.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph,  
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.SimpleGraph,  
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjancencyListGraph.
	* Moved the GraphPanelListener from the ui.swingviewer package to the graph package, and
	  renamed it in GraphViewerListener.
	* SwingGraphViewer and QtGraphViewer now implement GraphViewer.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swingviewer.SwingGraphViewer,  
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.qtviewer.QtGraphViewer.  

February 3 2008:
	* Added the A* algorithm.
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.AStar,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.test.TestAStar,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.test.TestAStar2.

Decemeber 29 2007:
	* Corrected a bug in GraphReaderDGS : number attributes were stored as a strings
	  instead of numbers. Added a new test that prints all the attributes of
	  a graph with their types.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDGS, 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.test.TestAttributes, 
	  	- org/miv/graphstream/io/test/data/Thing2.dgs

December 16 2007:
	* Deprecated the two getNodeSet() and getEdgeSet() Graph methods since they
	  make the assertion that such sets exist in the graph implementation, which
	  is not always the case. One must use iterators instead of these methods.
	  Also deprecated similar Node methods : getEdgeSet(), getEnteringEdgeSet()
	  and getLeavingEdgeSet() for the same reason.
	  Changed all the classes in the algorithm package according to this. All
	  other parts of the API should be changed also.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Node.
	* The tutorial 2 is out. The tutorial 3 is on its way.

December 9 2007:
	* Refactored CheckedGraph into SimpleGraph which is more intuitive. Identically,
	  CheckedNode and CheckedEdge have been refactored to SimpleNode and SimpleEdge.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.SimpleGraph, 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.SimpleNode, 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.SimpleEdge. 

December 7 2007:
	* Creation of new sub-package "rmi" in the package distributed (group all rmi stuff).
	* Added a "clean" GraphConnector interface which define all remote methods (independent
	of the communication layer rmi, .....).
	* Move all the class in the package distributed except GraphFactory an DistributedGraph
	* Added GraphFactory class which allow to create an instance of Graph (checked, Adjancency ...)
	* Added GraphConnectorFactory class which allow to create an instance of GraphConnector
	* Added GraphParseTag class which parse a node id or edge id and cut the string in 2 
	parts : id and the graphId the element belong to.
	The format of an element in a DistributedGraph is <graph id>/<element id>
	* Added GraphResourceIdentifier class which define all the information to localize a remote graph
	* Added GraphConnection class which encapsulate a GraphConnector from a GraphResourceIdentifier	
	* Added GraphServerRmi which launch a Connector listener (GraphConnectorRmiServer) over a 
	rmi server (start rmiregistry).

December 6 2007:
	* A small change in LayoutRunner that observe the stabilisation and slow down
	  calculations if the algorithm is stabilised at more than 90%. This should
	  help to reduce the CPU cost of the layout algorithm. However it is an
	  experimental feature.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.LayoutRunner.
	* The tutorial 1 is (at last) in the doc/web/tutorials/ directory. 

November 28 2007:
	* Modified the ConnectedComponents algorithm so that is can consider edges
	  as non-existent when they have a specific attribute set. Also added a
	  feature that set add an attribute on nodes according to the component they
	  pertain to. A set of values is given and the attribute is set to on of
	  these values according to the index of their component.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.ConnectedComponent. 

November 24 2007:
	* The Fruchterman-Reingold inspired layout algorithm is working. With the
	  dynamic recursive space decomposition, it speeds up things and allows to
	  layout graphs of more than 10000 nodes in less than a minute on a Pentium
	  M 1.7Gz.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.elasticbox.ElasticBox,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.elasticbox.test.TestElasticBox.

November 22 2007:
	* Added a whole new set of classes to build graph viewers using Qt Jambi
	  instead of Swing in the org.miv.graphstream.ui.qtviewer package. They
	  work the same as their Swing counterparts. Instead of a GraphPanel they
	  provide a GraphWidget. Default settings pane are also provided.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.qtviewer.*.
	* Added the ability to choose the layout class to use in GraphPanel and
	  GraphWidget.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.qtviewer.GraphWidget,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swingviewer.GraphPanel.
	* Added the base for a new graph layout based on the Fruchterman-Reingold
	  algorithm. It uses a recursive space decomposition instead of a mere grid
	  to speed up calculations. 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.elasticbox.ElasticBox.

November 12 2007:
	* Moved the org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphRendererRunner in the
	  org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing package as it is dedicated to swing only.

November 11 2007:
	* Changed the names of the classes in org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl package to
	  better match their goal and to be uniform with the names in the corresponding
	  swing package. They now begin by "Ogl" instead of "Graph3D".
	* Added a org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.OglGraphRendererQt and changed the
	  OglGraphRenderer into a OglGraphRendererSwing. The new class now allows
	  to use the QtJambi graphical toolkit instead of Swing.
	* Renamed the org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer package into org.miv.graphstream.ui.swingviewer
	  as it adds helper viewer classes for Swing only.

October 14 2007:
	* Removed a bug in the iterator inner classes of AdjacencyListGraph.
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjacencyListGraph
		 
October 4 2007 (Special Dresden Release):
	* Added a "Layout" interface so that SpringBox is no more the only way to
	  layout a graph. It will allow to implement several new layout algorithms
	  that will directly and transparently apply to any graph viewer.
	* Changed the way the layout work: it is now possible to add weights to
	  nodes and edges and the Layout interface allows to define "curved" edges.
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.Layout,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.LayoutListener,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.LayoutListenerHelper,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.LayoutRunner.

September 21 2007:
	* Modified the GML reader so that keywords are always converted into lower
	  case (some bad GML writers use mixed case in their keywords) and so that
	  the unknown attributes in "graphics" are ignored instead of triggering
	  an error. 
	* Added A mechanism that allow the dynamic creation of nodes and edges 
	  within a graph object. Each graph instance has a reference to a node and 
	  an edge factory. These factories are responsible for the the creation of inheriting
	  nodes add edges. The class name of the elements to be generated can be 
	  initialised with the org.miv.util.Evironment mechanism of by using a setter.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.NodeFactory 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.EdgeFactory
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.CheckedEdgeFactory
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.CheckedNodeFactory
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjacencyListEdgeFactory
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjajcencyListNodeFactory

September 19 2007:
	* Added a algorithms to compute the Newman-Girvan modularity on graphs.
	* Added the modularity(String), modularity(E[][]), modularityMatrix() and
	  communities() methods in Algorithm. The modularity(String) method is an
	  utility that calls communities(), modularityMatrix() and modularity(E[][]).
	  The communities() method group nodes in sets (communities) according to an
	  attribute whose value is used to select in which set a node must be placed.
	  The modularityMatrix() takes the communities computed and produce the e
	  matrix defined by Newman-Girvan. The modularity(E[][]) takes this matrix
	  as input and produce the modularity value.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Algorithms.
	* Added a Modularity algorithm class that makes the work of the communities()
	  method but is able to maintain dynamically the communities when the graph
	  evolves. When compute() is called, it performs only the creation of the e
	  matrix.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Modularity.
	* Added a Element.getAttributeCount() method that allows to know how many
	  attributes a graph element contains.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Element, 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AbstractElement, 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.OneAttributeElement. 

September 18 2007:
	* Added a Graph.algorithm() method that returns an instance of Algorithms
	  suited for the current graph instance and that allows to perform easily
	  and quickly several common algorithms on this graph instance. This
	  method allows to create several Algorithms descendants that will be able
	  to be optimized according to the internal representation of the Graph
	  implementation they work for.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.CheckedGraph,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjacencyListGraph.

September 3 2007:
	* Added a Welsh and Powell coloring algorithm.
		- org.miv.graphstream.aglorithm.coloring.WelshPowell,
		- org.miv.graphstream.aglorithm.test.TestWelshPowell.

August 28 2007:
	* Added a "Density" metric to the common algorithm.
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Algorithms.
	* Changed ConnectedComponents to work properly with big graphs. 
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.ConnectedComponents.
		
July 31 2007:
	* Added a SpringBoxListenerHelper class that allows to receive SpringBox
	  events in another thread than the spring box one. This allows the graph
	  node attributes to be modified automatically when the spring box changes
	  node positions and to listen at these changed for any other need.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.springbox.SpringBoxListenerHelper.
	* Added a way to register such a listener in the GraphPanel class. Note that
	  this is not the only way to listen at the spring box (since it impose to
	  display the graph in a panel. You can also create yourself a 
	  SpringBxRunner and put this listener in it).
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanel#addSpringBoxListener().
	* The Graph.display() methods now return the GraphViewer they create.
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph,
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.CheckedGraph,
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjacencyListGraph.

July 20 2007:
	* Added private methods (invisible to the user) that change the way events are managed.
	  If an event is created during the invocation of the listeners of another event, 
	  then it is temporary stored in a queue to be later executed in the right order.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.CheckedGraph
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.AdjacencyListGraph
	  	
July 19 2007:
	* Definitely use interfaces with graphs. Now the org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph 
	  class is an interface that provides common graph services. The same
	  for Node and Edge. 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Edge
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Node
	* The old set (GRaph,Node,Edge) is renamed Checked{Graph|Node|Edge}. 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.CheckedGraph
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.CheckedEdge
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.CheckedNode
	* Added a new set AdjacencyList{Graph|Node|Edge} that is less memory consuming
	  but slower.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjacencyListGraph
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjacencyListEdge
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AdjacencyListNode
	* org.miv.graphstream.graph.Element becomes an interface and the original 
	  Element class is changed into AbstractElement.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Element
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.AbstractElement
	* Add a Class that implements the Element interface and allow the use 
	  of only one attribute. 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.OneAttributeElement
	  	
July 13 2007:
	* Started to add interfaces in the graph sub-package so as to be able
	  to define more Graph classes. I don't know if it is THE solution. 

July 11 2007:
	* The GraphWriter.changeEdge() method now does not allow to change the edge
	  orientation. Also added a changeGraph() method that allows to put
	  attributes on the graph itself (GML can do this).
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriter.
	* Added an algorithm that compute the single source shortest path 
	  problem with the Bellman-ford algorithm.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.BellmanFord.
	  	
July 10 2007:
	* ShowGraph now displays an error message in the GUI when a parse error or
	  an I/O error occurs. This is ugly, but at least informative.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.tool.ShowGraph.
	* org.miv.graphstream.graph.Path: I tried to make it easier to use. 
	  Added documentation.
	* Changed Dijkstra algorithm. Hope it acts like the real one now.
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Dijkstra. 

July 9 2007:
	* Changed the SwingStyleSheet to allow it to load icons and images from
	  any where on the disk or the web, not only in the classpath or in jars.
	  The only thing needed is to add the "file:/" or "http://" before the
	  icon resource name.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingStyleSheet.

July 8 2007:
	* Started changes in the GraphReaderGML.
	  * It now accepts single unquoted words as identifiers for nodes, edges,
	    graphs, etc.
	  * Arbitrary attributes may be a structure, a string, a single unquoted
	    word or a number.
	  * Add the ability to parse dynamic graphs. The "step" keyword as been
	    added. The "chgnode", "delnode", "chgedge" and "deledge" keywords have
	    been added.
	  * Understand the "graphics" keyword and map it to the GraphStream
	    rendering capabilities.
	  * Single edges can be directed while the whole graph is not using
	    the "directed true" directive in edges.
	  * It is able to parse arbitrary attributes, made of subattributes and
	    map them to existing classes and their respective attributes. There is
	    a "map" keyword to define which attribute is mapped to which Java class.
	  * All the example graphs given on the GML site are now readable (at last).
	  * Added standars keywords "Creator" and "Version" to the list of known
	    keywords. They are transformed into attributes of the graph.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderGML

7 7 7:
	* Added the complexities in the graph package javadoc. Also deprecated the
	  algorithms (getClusteringCoefficient, getDegreeDistribution, etc.) in the
	  Graph class and redirected them to the
	  org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Algorithms class :
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Node,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Edge,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Element,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.DepthFirstIterator,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.BreadthFirstIterator.
	* Added the missing complexities in the org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Algorithms,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Dijkstra.

July 6 2007:
	* Added a tape-recorder like set of buttons to the ShowGraph utility that
	  allows to play/pause/advance event-by-event or step-by-step in a dynamic
	  graph. By default ShowGraph starts and directly reads the graph. It now
	  accepts the "-pause" option that allows to start it in "paused" state and
	  start the dynamic graph only when the "play" button is used.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.tool.ShowGraph.
	* Corrected some bugs in GraphReaderDGS that prevented the step-by-step
	  event reading feature to work properly.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDGS.

July 5 2007:
	* Add a pattern recognition for java.awt.Color.toString() in the
	  GraphicGraph.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicGraph
	* Correct a little bug in the GraphWriterDGS. String values of Object
	  parameters are now surrounded with quotes.
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterDGS	
		
July 4 2007:
	* Add getAverageDegree and getDegreeAverageDeviation to the list of simple
	  algorithms:
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Algorithms
		
July 3 2007:
	* Changed the BreadthFirstIterator so that it handles and respect edge
	  orientation. This is now a configurable option of the iterator.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.BreadthFirstIterator,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Node.
	* Added a DepthFirstIterator that does the same thing as the
	  BreadthFirstIterator, but explores the graph in a different order.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.DepthFirstIterator,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.graph.Node.

July 2 2007:
	* Added a GraphReaderWeb that does not read a file but an URL (either local
	  "file:/foo/bar" or distant "http://graphstream.sf.net"), and produces a
	  node for this page. Then it extracts all the links from this URL and
	  produces a node for each page found, adding a link from the start page to
	  all these new pages. This is done recursively until a given "depth" of
	  exploration is reached. The reader is able to produces nodes only for
	  sites, or for all pages found (this quickly produces very dense graphs, be
	  careful!).
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderWeb.
	* Changed the GraphReaderFactory so that when it encounters a file name that
	  starts with "http://" or "https://" or that ends with ".html" or ".htm" it
	  produces a GraphReaderWeb. This is disputable as there may exist a lot
	  more of extensions for web pages...
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderFactory
	* Added a new class in the tools named "Ferret". The ferret is a little
	  explorer that uses the GraphReaderWeb to produces graph files. It can
	  also display them as the exploration goes. TODO: add a GUI to this tool,
	  actually it only handles command line options... too bad.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.tool.Ferret.

June 28 2007:
	* Added a readerFor() method in GraphReaderFactory that takes a filename as
	  argument and a graph. It creates a GraphReaderListenerHelper and connects
	  the reader to the graph. This way each event will be propagated in the
	  graph.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderFactory.
	* Added a graph "recoder" that works as a listener for a graph and writes
	  all events occuring in the graph to a file.
	  	- org.miv;graphstream.io.GraphRecorder.

June 27 2007:
	* Added the JOGL jars and native libraries in the lib/ directory. Changed
	  the NOTICE accordingly.
	* Changed the GraphWriter interface. The obscure attribute filtering thing
	  is dead and removed. By default, all attributes are output. You can
	  filter them if you want, but you have to tell it (before, it was the
	  reverse, no attributes was output, unless they were unfiltered).
	  The corresponding graph writer implementations have been changed
	  accordingly:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriter,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterDGS,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterDOT,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterHelper (no more really needed though).
	* Changed the DGS graph format. The default format is now the 003 iteration.
	  There is no more node and edge typing lines at start. Attributes are no
	  more typed but must appear formated as: "name=value" or "name:value". The
	  value may be a string (quoted or not), a number or a symbol. It can also
	  be a sequence of string, number and symbols separated by commas (,). The
	  old DGS reader is still active but has been renamed GraphReaderDGS1And2.
	  The GraphReaderFactory is able to distinguish between the 001/002 formats
	  and the new 003 format and yield the correct reader. Also added the
	  ability do describe directed graphs in the DGS file. One can add the
	  optional symbol "<" or the symbol ">" between the nodes name when creating
	  an edge to direct it. For example "ae AB A > B" will create a directed
	  edge from A to B, whereas "ae AB A < B" will create a directed edge from
	  B to A and "ae AB A B" will still create a non directed edge.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDGS1And2 (the old GraphReaderDGS),
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDGS (new),
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderFactory.
	* Updated the manual for the GraphWriter heavy changes and documented the
	  DGS 003 format.
	  	- doc/Manual.asciidoc

June 26 2007:
	* Added an algorithm that performs a static or dynamic connected components 
	  computation. This class implements the 
	  org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.DynamicAlgorithm interface:
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.ConnectedComponents 

June 25 2007: 
	* Added a graph generator that displays nodes at random on a n dimensional 
	  space and then links them together depending on an threshold distance. 
	  The distance is 2-norm (Euclidean) distance, is able to work for any 
	  dimension space:
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.RandomEuclideanGenerator
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.test.TestRandomEuclideanGenerator
	* Little bug correction in the stream reading method: 	
		-org.miv.graphstream.io.GRaphReaderDGS 
		
June 12 2007:
	* Added a (pre-version of an) interface for graph algorithms in the
	  corresponding package. This interface is itself the foundation for another
	  that correspond to "dynamic" or "iterative" algorithms on graphs. That is,
	  algorithms that maintain a property in a graph, or continuously compute
	  it or reoptimize it.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Algorithm, 
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.DynamicAlgorithm. 
	* Added a APSP (all pairs shortest paths) algorithm that computes the
	  minimum length to go from one node to another (shortest path) for all
	  pairs of nodes in the graph. This algorithm is the basis to compute the
	  diameter of a graph. It handles directed and weighted graphs.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.APSP,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.test.TestAPSP.
	* Added a "@complexity" tag to the javadoc ant makefile. This will allow the
	  algorithms to specify cleanly their complexity. Also cleaned the build
	  file and corrected the bug that made all jar dependancies disapear. It
	  remains a problem with Jogl.
		- doc/javadoc/make.xml.
	* By default the ShowGraph GUI tries to load the "metouia" look&feel, added 
	  the metouia.jar in the libs. It fails silently if this does not work.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.tool.ShowGraph.

June 5 2007:
	* Corrected a bug in build.sh: the script forgot to include the
	  rgb.properties file.
	  	- build.sh.
	* Corrected a bug in the SwingGraphRenderer, SpringBox and GraphPanel that
	  used the wrong vector when dragging a node with the mouse and the
	  SpringBox was activated.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanel,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.springbox.SpringBox.

June 4 2007:
	* Corrected a bug in the SwinGraphRenderer: the interpolation was not done
	  if the graph do not move.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer.

May 28 2007:
	* The Swing renderer now interpolates the zoom and graph position/width so
	  that rapid changes in graph size or zooms are more easy to the eye:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingStyleSheet,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer.

May 18 2007:
	* Some sort of implementation of arrows for directed edges in the 3D panel,
	  (not really convincing, though):
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DUnit.

May 17 2007:
	* Added a public flag in GraphicGraph (GraphicGraph.graphChanged) that
	  allows to know if any part of the graph has been modified. Typically, the
	  graph renderer uses this flag to know if a repaint is needed. If needed,
	  the graph renderer must set this flag to false:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicData.GraphicGraph.
	* The SwingGraphRenderer respects the GraphicGraph.graphChanged flag and
	  stop to render frames if nothing changed in the display. This should
	  greatly improve performance when there is no graph layout process or when
	  the layout algorithm converged:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer.
	* The SpringBox now stops moving nodes (the "glue" option) if the nodes
	  move of a length that is less than a proportion of the graph space.
	  Before this was a constant. This proportion varies with the rendering
	  quality. This means that far less events are sent between threads, and
	  when the layout converged, the graph renderer can stop rendering frames:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.springbox.SpringBox.
	* Added the rotation in the SwingGraphRenderer (use ALT and the mouse wheel)
	  but it rotates texts and node shapes which is not what is wanted.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer.
	* Added an abstract base class to easily build generators with several
	  options, like labeling of nodes and edges, edge orientation, attributes,
	  etc.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.BaseGenerator.
	* Added a full graph generator:
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.FullGenerator,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.test.TestFullGenerator.
	* Added a random graph generator:
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.RandomGenerator,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.test.TestRandomGenerator.
	* Corrected a bug in the GraphReaderDOT that prevented the read() method
	  to work (only the by-event mode worked):
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDOT.
	* Added a GraphPanelListenerHelper that allows to forward the events from
	  the AWT/Swing thread where the GraphPanel sends events to another thread.
	  A demonstration of this is provided in the TestGraphPanelListener class,
	  where it is possible to select node and color them.
	  The mechanism is very simple, but has a major drawback: one needs to
	  verify regularly that events are available in the other thread (not the
	  Swing/AWT thread).
	  This drawback is however small when implementing programs where a thread
	  is constantly iterating on the dynamic graph, and for other sorts of
	  applications, usually the graph can be manipulated by the AWT/Swing
	  thread. The problem is that the usage of this mechanism is difficult to
	  explain to developpers:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanel,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanelListenerHelper,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.test.TestGraphPanelListener.
	* The Graph3DToSVG class no more draw a X mirrored graph + small style bugs
	  corrected:
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DToSVG.
	* Created a org.miv.graphstream.tool package and moved the ShowGraph
	  utility in it. Perhaps it should be interesting to change ShowGraph so
	  that if no argument is given, it opens a file selector:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.tool.ShowGraph.

May 16 2007:
	* Renamed several classes of the ui.ogl package:
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DCameraGroup,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DFrameBuffer,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DStyleSheet,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DToSVG,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3D3DUnit,	
	* Made several classes package-private since they are not part of the
	  GraphStream public API.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.springbox.MapCell,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderBase,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DCameraGroup,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DFrameBuffer,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DStyleSheet,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DToSVG,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3D3DUnit,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingStyleSheet,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphSettingsWindow.
	* Now the settings window of the GraphPanel appears when clicking with the
	  middle OR the third mouse button.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanel.
	* Added a GraphPanelListener that allows to now when a node is clicked.
	  Actually this listener is added to a GraphPanel. It is called inside the
	  Swing/AWT thread, which is usually a distinct thread from the one where
	  the graph is used.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphPanel,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphPanelListener.
	* The 3D graph renderer now is able to take screenshots in both bitmap and
	  vector formats. The SVG output handles the same rendering options as the
	  one of the 2D renderer.
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DToSVG,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DUnit,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DFrameBuffer,
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.Graph3DRenderer.
	  	- Last-minute bug!: the image is Y-inverted !!
	* One more bug with dijkstra's algorithm.
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Dijkstra

May 11 2007:
	* Node and Edge labels may be displayed or not by selecting check boxes in the option panel :
		- org.miv.graphstream.GraphRenderer
		- org.miv.graphstream.viewer.GraphSettingWindow
		- org.miv.graphstream.swing.SwingGraphRenderer
		- org.miv.graphstream.swing.SwingDegreeMap
		- org.miv.graphstream.gl.OpenGLGraphTRenderer
		 
May 10 2007:
	* Bug resolved : the clear method in graph had no effect in the layout
	  engine if existed.
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.SprinboxRunner.
	* The 3D graph renderer now handles all graphic attributes, styles and texts
	  excepted the arrows for directed edges. Activate it via the Environment:
	  		org.miv.util.Environment.getGlobalEnvironment().setParameter(
					"org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphViewer.GraphRendererClass",
					"org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.OpenGLGraphRenderer" );
			org.miv.util.Environment.getGlobalEnvironment().setParameter(
					"SpringBox.3d",
					"on" );
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.*;

May 9 2007:
	* The grid generator is now (finally) finished.
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.GridGenerator,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.test.TestGridGenerator,
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.test.TestGenerators.

May 8 2007:
	* The 3D graph renderer makes a come-back:
		- Not quite as advanced as the Swing graph renderer, but usable and in
		  three dimensions, for graphs that are definitely not planar. One must
		  use the Environement to ensure the springbox also enters in 3D mode
		  using the Environement (see the org.miv.graphstream.ui.test.ShowGraph
		  class for an example).
	  	- org.miv.graphstream.ui.ogl.*;
	* Added two options to the ShowGraph tool:
		- The -view3D uses the 3D graph renderer, and the -noLayout deactivate
		  the automatic node layout process. Maybe this tool should be moved out
		  of the ui.test package.
	* Added a small program to test the Graph memory consumption:
		- Call the TestLoadGraphInMemory on any graph file, it will tell you
		  the size used to store the corresponding graph in memory. Actually on
		  the WWW graph of Rka, Jeong and Barabsi
		  (http://www.nd.edu/~networks/resources.htm), with 325729 nodes and
		  1090108 (not counting auto-referencing edges), the Graph structure
		  uses 398 Mb !!! On disk with the "edge" format (which is a quite lite
		  format however) it takes only 20 Mb.
		- org.miv.graphstream.graph.test.TestLoadGraphInMemory.
	* Added a graph reader for the "edge" format:
		- The edge format is a very simple format where each line contains two
		  or more node names. The nodes are create implicitely when a node name
		  is encountered (the graph must be in auto-create mode). An edge is
		  created between the first node name on the line and all the other
		  node name on the line.
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderEdge,
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderFactory.
	* Added the ability to zoom and pan the displayed graph:
		- The zoom feature uses the mouse wheel.
		- The pan feature uses the keyboard arrows.
		- It is possible to reset everything using ALT-R.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanel,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphRenderer,
		- org.miv.graphstream.swing.SwingGraphRenderer,
		- org.miv.graphstream.swing.SwingStyleSheet.
	* Added the ability in the GraphicNode to handle X,Y,Z coordinates given as
		strings.
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.graphicData.GraphicNode.
	* Added the handling of alpha-channel values for node/edge colors:
		- The formats understood are now:
			- rgb(1,2,3),
			- rgba(1,2,3,4),
			- 0xaAbBcC, 0XaAbBcC, 0xaAbBcCdD, etc.,
			- #aAbBcC, #aAbBcCdD, etc.,
			- color names in the X11 RGB database.
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicData.GraphicGraph,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicData.GraphicEdge,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicData.GraphicNode.

May 7 2007:
	* Added edge styles in the GraphicGraph:
		- It is possible to set a style for edges, the property to set on edges
		  is "style" and the possible values are "filled" (or nothing), "dotted"
		  and "dashed".
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicGraph,
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicEdge.
	* Added the start of a GraphViz DOT graph writer.
		- It works but should be more tested.
		- org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterDOT.

May 7 2007: Release 0.2:
	* Possibility to show arrows in the GraphPanel/GraphViewer when an edge is directed.
	* Possibility to take screenshots of the GraphPanel/GraphViewer in SVG, PNG, JPG and BMP.
	* Possibility to display a backound image in the GraphPanel.GraphViewer.
	* Possibility to move nodes in the GraphPanel/GraphViewer with the mouse.
	* Convertion of color values in GraphViewer/GraphPanel from java.awt.Color, color names, hexadecimal format and HTML and CSS-like formats.
	* Ability to read,use,write directed graphs !

May 6 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphRenderer
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphSettingsWindow:
		- Added a checkbox to choose if the FPS counter is to be shown or not.
		- Added a slider to choose the quality of the rendering.
		- Added a GraphRenderer.setQuality() method.
		- Added a more questionable GraphRenderer.showFPS() method. Is this a
		  good idea ?
	* orv.miv.graphstream.algorithm.generator.GridGenerator (new class):
		- Allows to generate grids. The more the generator is iterated, the
		  more rows and columns are added. It is possible to ask for a simple
		  grid made of squares, or to add crossing diagonal links.
		- The "tore" option is not yet completely functionnal.
	* org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphWriterDGS:
		- Minor null controls for attributes.  
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphSettingWindow:
		- One more step to a video capture mode. One can take sequences of screenshot
		  with incremental filenames.
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.bufferedData (renamed into)
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph:
		- The BufferedGraph is renamed into GraphicGraph.
		- The BufferedNode is renamed into GraphicNode.
		- The BufferedEdge is renamed into GraphicEdge.
		- Changed the way this graph works, it is now plainly dedicated to
		  graphics as its name implies. It checks some attributes of the nodes
		  and edges and store graphics attributes like color, width, icons,
		  etc. It does the conversion from values given in attributes to
		  graphical classes. For example colors value are converted into a
		  java.awt.Color:
		  	- If it is already a java.awt.Color, it is kept :-)
		  	- If it is a color name (X11 RGB database) it is converted;
		  	- If it is in hexadecimal format (0xFFFFFF) it is conveted;
		  	- If it is in HTML-like format (#FFFFFF) it is converted;
		  	- If it is in CSS-like format (rgb(1,10,100)) it is converted.
		  The same for width attributes:
		  	- If it is a Number it is directly used;
		  	- If it is a string a convertion is tried toward a double.
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingEdgeRenderer:
		- Corrected a bug that prevented the arrow to grow if the specified
		  edge width was not 1.
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRender:
		- The node picking algorithm (findNodeAt) that allow to grab a node and
		  drag it on screen, did not took the node width in account.

May 05 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphRendererRunner:
		- Replace the list of components with only one component. 
		  The list used to allow the creation of different display of a same
		  graph in the same viewer panel but it is not easy nor convenient to
		  use.
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphRenderer:
		- A new method to find if a node under the mouse, by giving two device
		  coordinates.
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer
	* org.miv.graphsrteam.ui.viewer.GraphPanel:
		- It is now possible to click on nodes to grab them and drag them at
		  any place inside the window. There is still a problem with the fact
		  that the view constantly recenter itself around the graph.
		- Removed the Exception generated when a node was clicked on a non-layouted graph.
		- Tried to allow the drag and drop of nodes on a non-layouted graph but it is a crap ! 
			.Now there is a  clean way to  drag and drop nodes on a non-Layouted graph. 
	* org.miv.graphsrteam.ui.viewer.SettingsWindow
	* org.miv.graphsrteam.ui.viewer.GraphSettingWindow (new class)
		- Implementation of the ScreenShot feature. The user with a middle 
		  click on the mouse wheel accesses to the contextual menu that allow 
		  the creation of screenshot. 
		  Depending on the graph renderer used, the list of possible image types
		  may vary. The default SwingGraphRenderer provides svg, png, jpg and
		  bmp outputs.
	* org.miv.graphsrteam.ui.swing.SwingRenderingInfo
		- Renamed SwingStyleSheet.
	* org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDOT:
		- The GraphViz DOT reader can now support general nodes/edges/graphs
		  attributes set once for all nodes and edges.
	* org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.Dijkstra :
		- Modifications in the algorithm so as it is able to find  shortest paths in directed graphs. It  also handles negative values 
	* org.miv.graphstream.graph.Path:
		- Resolved bug:  the getNodePath() method used to return a disordered list.  
	
May 04 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph:
		- Corrected a bug that sent an addNode event in non-strict mode when
		  an existing node was anew inserted. This bug made the GraphViewer
		  a bit crazy.
		- Corrected a bug that prevented to insert a directed edge from B to A
		  if a directed edge from B to A already existed. An error must be
		  reported only if the already existing edge is non directed.
	* org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDOT:
		- More tests on the DOT import.
		- It handles directed and non directed graphs.
		- It reads attributes and store them in the graph.
		- It handles colors attributes and convert them into the correct Color
		  object. There are more than 800 color names defined by the DOT format,
		  they are loaded on demand from a file stored in the graphstream.jar.
	* org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReader, GraphReaderListener:
		- Now the GraphReader sends edge events that inform on the fact that an
		  edge is directed or not.	
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.bufferedData.*:
		- The BufferedGraph now supports directed edges.
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingEdgeRenderer:
		- The edge renderer now draws arrows if an edge is directed.
		- The edge labels are not drawn if specified.

May 03 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDOT:
		- A new reader for the GraphViz DOT format. Not yet fully tested. It
		  does not support subgraphs.

May 02 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.*:
		- Reorganized some classes. Moved some inner classes out of their mother.
		  Made some classes package protected since they are not part of the
		  public API.
		- Added several features to the "settings" window that appears when one
		  middle click on a GraphPanel/GraphViewer:
		    - A possibility to output a file containing the coordinates of each
		      node in the graph associated to the node identifiers, a.k.a. a
		      "position file".
		    - A possibility to choose the layout quality on five levels from
		      "fast" to "best", best being naturally slower.
		    - Added values on the force setting slider.
		    -> Lot more things to add for changing the appearance and make
		      screenshots.

April 27 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.graph.Graph:
		- Added a readPositionFile(String) utility method that read a file whose
		  format is:
		    nodeId1: 0 0 0
		    nodeId2: 1 3 5
		    etc..
		  This file maps node identifiers to coordinates and equip the graph
		  with pre-computed positions for each node. This avoid to use a graph
		  layout algorithm (or use it only once).

April 26 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.swing.SwingNodeRenderer, SwingRenderingInfo, SwingGraphRenderer:
		- Added the ability to render nodes as images. This works like color by
		  putting a "icon" attribute on the node and giving an URL for the image
		  name. The image can be read from the disk or from a jar file. Nodes
		  can have each a distinct icon or the same. Nodes with the same icon
		  share the same image using a caching mechanism. It is possible to put
		  the "nodeIcon" attribute on the graph so that the icon is shared by all
		  the nodes.
		- Added the ability to put the "nodeColor" and "edgeColor" attributes on
		  the graph to change the default color of each node or edge at once.

April 25 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.io.test.TestGraphReaderQuick:
		- changed the name from TestGraphReader2
	* org.miv.graphstream.io.GraphReaderDGS and GraphReaderBase
		- Removed the bug that disallowed empty lines and EOF at the end of
		  a line containing data.
		- Removed a bug that put the graph attributes into each node and edge
		  attributes if the DGS file did not specified node or edge attributes.
		- Comments are now possible in DGS files, they start with a '#' sign
		  and last until the end of the line.

April 20 2007:
	* org.miv.graphsream.ui.swing.SwingGraphRenderer
		- Implementation of the background image feature : An image filename can be specified in the parameter table (org.miv.util.Environment). 
		The background  may be displayed with at a given position with a given dimension in the user space (graph space) coordinate.
		The corresponding parameters are :
			. drawBackground : the boolean that define weather or the background has to be displayed.
			. backgroundImage : the string filename of the image
			. backgroundPositionX : the float left origin position on the image expressed in user space coordinate.   
			. backgroundPositionY : the float top origin position on the image expressed in user space coordinate.
			. backgroundWidth: the float width of the  image expressed in user space coordinate.   
			. backgroundPositionX : the float height of the image expressed in user space coordinate.   
	* org.miv.graphsream.ui.swing.SwingRenderingInfo
		- The constructor now tries to modify the values of its fields with the org.miv.uitil.Environment parameter table.

April 19 2007:
	* implementation of the "clear graph" feature in the GraphRenderer and the StringBox layout engine. Concerned classes are :
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.bufferedData.BufferedGraph
		- org.miv.graphstream.ui.graphRendererRunner
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.SpringBox
		- org.miv.graphstream.algorithm.layout.SpringBoxRunner
		 

April 12 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanel and GraphViewer:
		- Moved the duplicated code inside GraphPanel only.
		- The GraphViewer is now only an utility class of 50 lines that wraps a
		  GraphPanel inside a JFrame.
		- The main class for easy insertion of a graph in a GUI is now the
		  GraphPanel.
		- It remains a lot of work to do for the settings window that appear
		  when one middle-click inside the GraphPanel.

April 05 2007:
	* org.miv.graphstream.ui.viewer.GraphPanel:
		- Added the GraphPanel class that does the same thing as the GraphViewer
		  but does not create a JFrame. This is an easy way to add a graph
		  component into an existing application GUI.
		- Maybe the GraphPanel and the GraphViewer, that share the same code
		  could be merged ?

April 02 2007:
